<!-- +Frist Problem:
+# You have 100 cats (You are quite lucky to own so many cats!).
+
+# You have arranged all your cats in a line. Initially, none of your cats 
+# have any hats. You take 100 rounds walking around the cats, always starting 
+# at the beginning. Every time you stop at a cat, you put a hat on it if it 
+# doesn't have one, and you take its hat off if it has one on.
+
+# The first round, you stop at every cat. The second round, you only stop at 
+# every 2nd cat (#2, #4, #6, #8, etc.). The third round, you only stop at 
+# every 3rd cat (#3, #6, #9, #12, etc.). You continue this process until the 
+# 100th round (i.e. you only visit the 100th cat).
+
+# Write a program that prints which cats have hats at the end.
+
+
+Seconde Problem:
+# Write a method that takes an array of stock prices (prices on days
+# 0, 1, ...), and outputs the most profitable pair of days on which to
+# first buy the stock and then sell the stock, e.g.: stock_picker( [ 44,
+# 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38 ] ) == [ 2, 6 ] -->
